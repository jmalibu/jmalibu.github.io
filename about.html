	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I'm a <b>writer</b>, <b>marketing executive</b>, and <b>angel investor</b>. I live in San Francisco, and I'm originally from Los Angeles. I started my career in television series development, and I had the good fortune to work on some of my own favorite shows (<i>The Office</i>, <i>The Simpsons</i>, <i>Family Guy</i>, <i>30 Rock</i>, and others). Later I moved over to the tech world, where I've been at companies both enormous and tiny.</p>

	<p>I've been interested in Front-End Web Design and Development for most of my life, but only recently have I carved out the time to teach myself the basics. For someone who's worked in the tech industry for as many years as I have, that's kind of embarrassing. But at least I'm rectifying things now!</p>
	
	<p>I'm launching a blog soon, and I'd love for that blog to look and feel at least semi-professional. And I'd like to become more self-sufficient with web elements and design, so that I can handle all aspects of the Marketing function without too much technical handholding.</p>

	<h2>My Mission</h2>

	<p>I was on the fence about calling this section "My Goal," but "My Mission" sounds more fun. It packs a punch. It makes a statement. Anyhow, as I learn more about front-end, I'd like to bring these skills to bear at my next startup. I like startups because I enjoy working at companies that move frighteningly fast and aim dangerously high.</p>
